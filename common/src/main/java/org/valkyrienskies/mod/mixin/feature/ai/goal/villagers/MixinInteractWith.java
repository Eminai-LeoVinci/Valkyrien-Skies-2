/**
 * Reduce villager-to-villager socializing (the idle face-to-face "gather") for villagers ON SHIPS
 * ONLY. Native overworld villagers are byte-identical -- the gate below early-returns whenever the
 * initiator is not currently being dragged by a ship, so vanilla {@code canInteract} runs unchanged.
 *
 * <p><b>Lever.</b> The gather is driven by the vanilla idle behavior
 * {@code InteractWith.of(EntityType.VILLAGER, INTERACTION_TARGET)}: it scans for the nearest
 * villager that passes the private static {@code canInteract} helper ({@code method_46959}) and, on
 * success, sets LOOK_TARGET (face) + WALK_TARGET (approach) + INTERACTION_TARGET (gossip). If we
 * force that helper to reject every candidate, the scan finds no partner and no social targets are
 * set; the idle {@code RunOne} then spends that tick on an inert no-op (identical to vanilla's
 * "no villager nearby" case) and strolls on its other idle picks. Work / sleep / POI targeting are
 * produced by entirely separate behaviors and are untouched.
 *
 * <p><b>Rotating ~{@link #VS$SHIP_SOCIAL_PERCENT}% cohort.</b> Each villager is independently rolled
 * "social" or not for the current ~{@link #VS$SOCIAL_WINDOW_TICKS}-tick window via a UUID-seeded
 * hash, so roughly that fraction is eligible at any moment and which villagers rotate between
 * windows (rather than the same villagers being permanent chatterboxes forever).
 *
 * <p><b>Two-sided gate.</b> Gating only the initiator lets an eligible villager lock onto an
 * ineligible neighbour and drag it into a visible face-up, inflating the realized gather fraction.
 * So a pairing requires BOTH the initiator and a villager candidate to be in the cohort. The
 * realized visible fraction therefore tends to sit at or a little below
 * {@link #VS$SHIP_SOCIAL_PERCENT} (sparser decks undershoot); treat the constant as a tunable, not a
 * perfectly linear knob.
 *
 * <p><b>Shared-helper note.</b> {@code method_46959} is also reached by on-ship villager-initiated
 * breeding / cat walk-up, so the non-cohort fraction is mildly damped there too. Acceptable: it is
 * rotating (averages out across windows) and never blocks breeding, only paces it. Cat/animal
 * <i>initiators</i> are untouched (the gate requires the initiator to be a {@link Villager}).
