/**
 * Entity light on ships.
 *
 * <p>Entities carried by a ship (players, mobs, armor stands) are WORLD entities at world positions, but a
 * ship's blocks -- and their light sources (torches, lanterns, glowstone) -- live in the far-off shipyard
 * region, NOT at the entity's world coordinates. Vanilla samples block light at the entity's world position,
 * which is empty open space: at night, with skylight 0 and no world blocks there, everything on deck renders
 * pitch black. Disassembling the ship moves the blocks back into world space, so lighting works again.
 *
 * <p>Fix: for each ship whose world AABB contains the entity, sample BLOCK light at the entity's corresponding
 * shipyard position and take the brighter of (world, ship). Block light is the channel that matters -- skylight
 * is dominated by the open-sky value at the floating world position and already behaves.
 *
 * <p>FRAME-INDEPENDENCE (the moving-ship flicker fix): vanilla feeds in the INTERPOLATED render probe
 * ({@code getLightProbePosition(partialTick)}). An entity standing still RELATIVE to a moving ship has a
 * CONSTANT ship-local position, so its ship-light sample must be frame-independent -- but the interpolated
 * probe advances smoothly between ticks while the ship transform steps once per tick, so feeding the
 * interpolated probe through any ship transform leaves a sub-tick mismatch that oscillates the sampled
 * shipyard block: a flicker that scales with ship speed. So we sample at {@code getLightProbePosition(1.0)}
 * (the current-tick logical probe, no interpolation) through the ship's current (physics) transform -- both
 * "this tick" -- so a stationary-relative entity hits the same block every frame; a walking entity still steps
 * light per tick (normal). Covers player/mob/armor-stand (all inherit getBlockLightLevel).
